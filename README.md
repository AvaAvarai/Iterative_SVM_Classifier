# Iterative SVM Classifier

Novel classifier with SVM iteratively refining class borders from our recent paper, now expanding studies.

Achieved 100% accuracy on WBC 9 and 30 attribute datasets in our upcoming paper "Boosting of Classification Models with Human-in-the-Loop Computational Visual Knowledge Discovery."
